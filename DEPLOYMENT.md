# Production Deployment Guide

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# For production deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://backend-rest-api-jwt-auth-rolebased.onrender.com

# For local development, use:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## Key Changes Made for Production Routing

1. **Fixed AuthContext routing logic** - Prevents infinite redirects in production
2. **Updated middleware configuration** - Better handling of public routes and API routes
3. **Added trailingSlash configuration** - Ensures consistent routing behavior
4. **Environment-based BASE_URL** - Automatically switches between dev and production APIs
5. **Added loading states** - Prevents flash of content during authentication

## Deployment Steps

1. Set the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your production API URL
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Start the production server: `npm start`

## Common Production Issues Fixed

- ✅ Infinite redirect loops between login and dashboard
- ✅ Middleware blocking API routes
- ✅ Inconsistent routing behavior between dev and production
- ✅ Flash of content during authentication
- ✅ Hard-coded localhost URLs in production
